  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished in the northwestern region of South Asia around 3300‚Äì1300 BCE. It was one of the world‚Äôs earliest urban societies, noted for its advanced town planning, drainage systems, and craft specialization. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Among the artifacts discovered in Harappan excavations is the toy cart ‚Äî a small terracotta model of a wheeled cart. These miniature models likely served as children‚Äôs toys or ritual items, but they also reflect the technological and craft skill of the society. The existence of wheels, axles, wooden carts, and domesticated animals is inferred from such models, demonstrating the Indus people‚Äôs familiarity with transport and craftsmanship.

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    The toy carts are often found in city sites like Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, and Dholavira, indicating a cultural continuity across the civilization‚Äôs wide extent. They offer important clues about everyday life in Harappan cities: trade, movement of goods, and possibly symbolic or ritual processions.

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Though much of the Indus script remains undeciphered, the material remains ‚Äî seals, weights, beads, pottery ‚Äî show a well-organized society with craft specialization, standardization, and interregional trade. The toy cart thus stands as a small but telling emblem of that sophistication.
